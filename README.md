# Stardew Valley Mods
Several mods created for Stardew Valley 1.6. I mainly make these mods because it's fun to do and to practise some pixelart. I will probably redo a lot along the way. Any suggestions or feedback are always welcome! (hmu on Discord)

## Requirements
All mods have the same requirements:
* SMAPI (4.0 or up)
* Content Patcher
